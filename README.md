# Network Project

This project was a short but interesting one. 

The objectives were the following :

- Set up 2 asterisks servers
   
- Set up 2 soft-phones on our computers or android phones.
   
- Intercept the SIP communication between a soft-phone and the asterisk server.
   
- Intercept the RTP data communication between the 2 soft-phones.
   
- Encrypt the SIP communication using SSL/TLS.
   
- Encrypt the RTP data communication using ZRTP.
   
- Intercept the communication while it's encrypted and prove that the encryption is efficient and reliable.
   
- Doing a trunk SIP between the two asterisks servers.

- Try the same things when the two clients are connected on two different asterisks servers.
